R Shiny App for Card Sorting Data Analysis

Are you still using IBM's EZSort for analyzing card sorting data? 

Come on! [EZSort is dead](http://maadmob.net/donna/blog/2005/ibms-usort-and-ezsort-are-dead), why not try your card sorting data with our new online cardsorting tool? ([Live Demo] (http://glimmer.rstudio.com/yong/cardsorting/) hosted on RStudio Shiny Server, thanks!)

## To run it on your own machine (with R installed):

1. Clone, or [Download] (https://github.com/jun9/cardsorting/archive/master.zip) and unzip the source code from github.
2. Set the "cardsorting" folder as your working directory in R.
3. library('shiny')
4. runApp()
